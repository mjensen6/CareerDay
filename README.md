    ```bash
    cd Documents
    ```

    ```bash
    mkdir first
    cd first
    ```
    
    - touch - “create file” and rm “remove”

    rm first_program.sh
    ```
    
    - echo - “input text”
    
    ```bash
    echo hello world
    echo "echo hello world" >> second_program.sh
    ```
    
    - cat - “read file”
    
    ```bash
    cat second_program.sh
    ```
    
    - bash - “run file”
    
    ```bash

    - 
    
    ```bash
    python3 some_python_file.py
    ```
